      <pre># Time Clock (GitHub Pages) — Eastern Time + Excel Backup

This is a **static** time clock you can host on **GitHub Pages**.
It stamps timestamps in **America/New_York (Eastern Time)** and exports to **CSV** or **Excel (.xlsx)**.

## What it does
- Requires: **Name + Company + Date (EST)** (a simple sign-in).
- One-click buttons:
  - Clock In
  - Lunch Out
  - End Lunch
  - Clock Out
- Stores entries locally in the browser (LocalStorage).
- Export:
  - CSV
  - XLSX (Excel)

## Why “everyone’s time in one master sheet” is tricky on GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is **static** (no database). That means:
- Each person’s log stays on *their device/browser*.
- The normal workflow is: employees export Excel/CSV and send it to you → you paste/merge into a master sheet.

### Best “no-backend” workflow
1) You publish this on GitHub Pages and send the link to employees  
2) Each employee clocks their day  
3) At end of day/week they click **Export Excel** and send it to you  
4) You combine exports into **Master Log** (template button included)

## Optional: auto-backup to a Google Sheet (simple + free)
If you want a true “everyone goes into the same sheet automatically”, the easiest serverless option is:
- Create a Google Sheet
- Add a Google Apps Script Web App as an endpoint
- The site can POST each stamp to the sheet

I did **not** hard-code your sheet URL (for security). If you want, tell me and I’ll add:
- A settings box to paste your Web App URL
- “Auto-sync on every stamp” toggle

## Deploy to GitHub Pages (quick)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (example: `timeclock`)
2. Upload these files:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `app.js`
3. In GitHub: **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` / root
4. Your site goes live at the Pages URL GitHub gives you.

## Notes
- Time zone is forced to **America/New_York** even if someone is traveling.
- Works on phones + desktop.
